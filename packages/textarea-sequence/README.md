### Properties

#### `sequence` ___[Read Only]___

The current value of the text-area.

type: `string`

#### `errors` ___[Read Only]___

The current value of the error report. In the shape of an object, where the keys are the type of error, and their values are booleans indicating if the current text has that error.

type: `object`

Example:
```javascript
{
  hasInvalidCharacters: false,
  missingFirstHeader: false,
  multipleSequences: false,
  tooShort: true, // The current sequence is too short
}
```
#### `quill`

We use quill to apply the formatting of the textarea. The object related to it, is exposed in this parameter.
See the [Quill API documentation](https://quilljs.com/docs/api/) for more details of what can you do with this object.

type: `object`


#### `formatSequence`

A formatting function to use in the cleanUp method. It should add desired spaces a line splits.

The signature of the function should be: 

`<string> formatSequence(<string> sequence)`

type: `function`
defaultValue: Splits the sequence in lines of 50, adding a space every 10 characters

parameters:

- sequence: type: `string`

Returns
- `string`

**Note:** This parameter can be overwritten, so you can define such format. For example, to avoid any formatting you can pass the identity function:

```javascript
document.getElementByID("textareaID").formatSequence = x => x;
```


### Methods

#### `cleanUp()`

This method tries to clean up the current sequence in the textarea, in the following way:

- Adds a generated header to the sequence in case is missing
- Removes any character that is not included in the current `alphabet`
- Trims lines and get rid of spaces
- If the attribute `single` is `true`, it will keep the first sequence and remove the rest.
- Executes the `formatSequence` function to include spaces and line lengths.


### Events

#### `error-change`

Is dispatched when there is a change in the reported errors. Includes the `errors` object in the details.

Usage example:
```javascript
element.addEventListener("error-change", e => {
  console.log(e.detail.errors);
});
```

#### Quill Events
As mentioned before, we use quill, and its instance is exposed in the parameter `quill`. Quill implement some events, that you could also use. See the [Quill API documentation](https://quilljs.com/docs/api/#events) for more details.

Usage Example:
```javascript
element.quill.on("text-change", e => {
  console.log(element.sequence);
});
```
