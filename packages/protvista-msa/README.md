# protvista-msa

A custom element that visualises multiple sequences alignments. It is basically a wrapper of [react-msa-viewer](https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/react-msa-viewer) that plays along with other nightingale components.

It currently uses the `clustal` color scheme, and only displays the alignment, none of the other components includede in `react-msa-viewer`. it uses the scroll only to move vertically.

## Usage

```html
<protvista-msa
  id="msa-track"
  length="300"
  height="200"
  displaystart="10"
  displayend="30"
  use-ctrl-to-zoom
  labelWidth="100"
/>
```

##### `height`
